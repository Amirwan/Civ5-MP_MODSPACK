			<Text>Enderun Academy was established by Mehmed II in Constantinople. Promising devsirmes (often kidnapped Christian children from the Balkans) and sons of prominent Ottoman officials were trained in literature, theology, engineering, mathematics etc. at Enderun, preparing them for government service as civil servants and janissaries. The janissaries became rivals to the landed Timariot sipahi soldiers that made up the bulk of the Ottoman army, and tensions were inevitable between the two classes.</Text>
