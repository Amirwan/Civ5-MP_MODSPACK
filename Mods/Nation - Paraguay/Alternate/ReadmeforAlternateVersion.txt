	Readme for Alternate Version.

-----

	An alternate version of Paraguay, which yields science from great works and 
	replaces misiones with Univeristy instead of Temple is available.

	The reason behind this is that in fact the bonuses fit  bit more and go along with
	a theme, unlike the main version ones. However, the main version was kept because of how 
	complicated are jungles without production; hence we left the production bonus and the
	Temple misiones.

	Anyway, if you'd rather have the alternate version, simply replace the files from this
	folder with the original ones (I reccommend back-uping) Have fun! :D
