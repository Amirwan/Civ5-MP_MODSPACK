			<Text>Located off the shore of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Palm Jumeirah is a large archipelago created by man in the shape of a palm tree. It was announced in 2001, and originally was intended to be one of three "Palm Islands" along with the Palm Jebel Ali and the Palm Deira, which was intended to be the largest of the three islands at the time. The archipelago has a total area of 25 square kilometres, comparable to over 800 American football pitches. Palm Jumeriah consists of a central trunk, connected to the mainland by a 300 metre long bridge, sixteen fronds of the palm, and an 11 kilometre breakwater surrounding the construction. In total, the islands more than doubled Dubai's existing coastline. The islands are also a hotbed for new developments and resorts, much like the rest of Dubai. The Atlantis resort opened on the breakwater in 2008, which later became a symbol of the developments.</Text>
