				A minister in our court has spoken up against the Countess Elizabeth Báthory, accusing her of wicked crimes against the Hungarian people. He alleges that the Countess has an insatisable obsession with torture and death, and that, at her hands, countless young women - of noble and common birth alike - have been tortured to death. These crimes are very serious, and we must not let them go unpunished if true.[NEWLINE]
