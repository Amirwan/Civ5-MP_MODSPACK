			<Description>Gusar</Description>
			<Civilopedia>Gusar light cavalry forces were part of the medieval Serbian military. Armed with spears and pentagonal wood shields padded with metal, they supported the noble knights as their second line on the battlefield. In the middle of each wooden shield, there was a round metal knob that held the shield together. Gusar light cavalries were a traditional Serbian force, which meant that they usually were not hired as mercenaries from Spain or Germany. Their style of fighting was similar to the noble knights. They used the eastern style of fighting: they would charge into the enemy ferociously, and try to cause mass havoc. As for their role with the foot soldiers, they were more like support cavalry. When the foot soldiers were losing the battle, the Gusars would charge into the enemy's flank, hoping to cause them to rout. They would repeat this charge from different angles while the infantry kept the enemy from chasing the Gusars.</Civilopedia>
			<Strategy>The Gusar replaces the Pikeman. The Gusar is a mounted unit with 4 [ICON_MOVES] Movement Points and Promotions Mounted Units would have. It is just as effective against other Mounted Units as the Pikeman, but does not require [ICON_RES_HORSE] Horses. These units gain a large Attack bonus versus units when next to a damaged friendly unit. Mounted units adjacent to Gusars gain +20% [ICON_STRENGTH] Combat Strength.</Strategy>

			<Description>Kefalija</Description>
			<Civilopedia>Serbian nobility was the privileged order or class (aristocracy) of Serbia in the Middle Ages and early modern period. The first nobles of greater status were those in the 9th and 10th century, who were connected to the royal family by marriage. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the nobility greatly expanded, and in the Serbian Empire lavish titles were given in the Byzantine order. With the fall of Serbia in the 15th century, Serbian nobility survived in Montenegro, Venetian territories and in the Austro-Hungarian lands. In the 19th century, with the independence from the Ottoman Empire, a new nobility based out of warriors and other wealthy intelligentsia emerged.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the late Byzantine Empire, the term kephale was used to denote local and provincial governors. In essence, the kephale replaced the Komnenian-era doux as the civil and military governor of a territorial administrative unit, known as a katepanikion. In size, these provinces were small compared to the earlier themata, and could range from a few villages surrounding the kephale's seat, to an entire island. This arrangement was also adopted by the Second Bulgarian Empire and Serbian Empire.</Civilopedia>
