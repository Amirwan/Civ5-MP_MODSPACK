			already has 3 Shrines (in this case) it will only gift 1; a good option for altering this is creating an alternate version of the building; 
			but you'd have to copy the effects from policies and etc. In this case its not necessary because the tech to unlock the free buildings 
			is also the prereq tech; so its impossible the player has Shrines before the condition is met -->
